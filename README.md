# Space Telemetry
This is the source code for <https://www.telemetry.space>.

We'd love to know your ideas and corrections and [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

Below are the instructions for getting a copy of the source code
setup for development on your computer. If you run into any issues getting these instructions to work for you, let us know.

# Prerequisites for Development
## Linux

_TBD: if you set this up on Linux, please let us know what else you had to do
or just write it into this README.md and send a pull request._


## Mac

### XCode

Install Xcode <https://developer.apple.com/xcode/> and it's command line tools. We also recommend the nicely packaged [Postgres.app](https://postgresapp.com), though any method of installation should work.


## Windows
_TBD: if you set this up on Windows, please let us know what else you had to do
or just write it into this README.md and send a pull request._


# Development Setup
## io.js

Install io.js from: <https://iojs.org> and Foreman to run the application in the same manner as Heroku, more at <https://strongloop.github.io/node-foreman/>:

        $ npm install foreman --global

## PostgreSQL:

1. Download and install 9.4.x: <https://www.postgresql.org/download/>.
2. Be sure to set your PATH to use the binaries in Postgres.app if using it.
3. Setup a user and two databases in PostgreSQL (the names can be changed if
you like):

        $ createuser --echo --createdb --no-createrole --no-superuser --pwprompt --encrypted space_telemetry_app
        $ createdb --echo --encoding=utf-8 --owner=space_telemetry_app space_telemetry_dev
        $ createdb --echo --encoding=utf-8 --owner=space_telemetry_app space_telemetry_test

4. Run each of the SQL files found in db in order by file name, for example:

        $ psql --dbname space_telemetry_dev --user space_telemetry_app --file db/ddl-001.sql --password
        $ psql --dbname space_telemetry_dev --user space_telemetry_app --file db/ddl-002.sql --password
        $ psql --dbname space_telemetry_dev --user space_telemetry_app --file db/ddl-003.sql --password
        $ psql --dbname space_telemetry_dev --user space_telemetry_app --file db/ddl-004.sql --password

5. Run each of the SQL files found in db in order by file name, this time for
the test DB, for example:

        $ psql --dbname space_telemetry_test --user space_telemetry_app --file db/ddl-001.sql --password

        $ etcâ€¦


## Space Telemetry

1. Checkout the "develop" or "master" branches as you prefer; master is what you
see at <https://www.telemetry.space> and develop is what we're working on.

        $ git checkout develop

2. Copy .env.example to .env _and_ .env.test and change the values as
appropriate, e.g., replace MY_USER, MY_PASSWORD, and MY_DATABASE to those you used above.

3. Install all the libraries and tools:

        $ npm install


## Run Locally
Foreman starts web processes on port 5000; this cannot be changed until a bug
in the node version of Foreman is fixed:
<https://github.com/strongloop/node-foreman/issues/69>

    $ nf start

To automatically recompile the client files whenever you save changes to them,
keep the following running (omit the watch flag to compile once and exit):

    $ npm run webpack -- --watch

To run all the tests and generate code coverage (reported in detail in
`coverage/lcov-report/index.html`):

    $ npm run test

To run tests automatically when you save a change:

    $ npm run test-watch

And, to run one test file without coverage and with full traces:

    $ npm run test1 /test/path/to/my/test.js --loglevel silent


# Making a Great Pull Request
1. Familiarize yourself with GitHub pull requests: <https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/>

2. Fork this repository.

3. Create a topic branch (in your fork) from the tip of the develop branch, for
example if your adding a fancy feature, you'd create your topic branch from develop by running:

        $ git checkout -b add-some-fancy-feature develop

4. Add tests to test/client or test/server for all your changes and use the coverage report to hunt for any dead code or missing tests.

5. Write code that passes the jshint and jscs rules:

        $ npm run jscs
        $ npm run jshint

6. Send a pull request!
